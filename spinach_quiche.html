        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One sheet shortcrust pastry (or puff if you prefer)</li>
            <li>1kg frozen whole leaf spinach</li>
            <li>Bacon lardons / Diced chorizo</li>
            <li>300ml double cream</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>200g shredded / fresh mozzarella + 200g shredded cheese of your choice</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, optional dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>Any fillings are acceptable really. It goes well with mushrooms, chilli peppers, carrots, just to name a few.</li>

        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook spinach until loose but not pasty. Drain and cool completely (drain as much liquid as possible);</li>
            <li>Shallow fry bacon lardons / chorizo until crispy. Drain fat</li>
            <li>Pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees and lay out your pastry sheet in a quiche tin / mold (or any mold you want really, I've made this in loaf tins cake tins whatever tin you can think of I have tried em</li>
            <li>Mix eggs, cream, salt, pepper, chilli flakes in a bowl, then add your spinach and stir-in well. Add your bacon, your grated cheese, and whatever other fillings you choose and mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into pastry sheet, add fresh mozzarella bits now if using, and bake for 20-30 minutes. You will be looking for a somewhat crispy top and if successful gooey but not watery middle.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool before serving so the mixture sets. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
